## Questions

1. Why does your program need a setup and a loop?

    The set up is needed to initialize pins as outputs or inputs. The loop is needed to run processes that need to be repeated over and over again.

2. What is the downside to putting all your code in a loop?

    It would be less efficient because parts of the code involved in the setup that only need to be called once would be called every single time the loop is run.

3. Why does your code need to be compiled?

    The computer can only read machine code, so the arduino code needs to be changed into machine code.

4. When lowering the frequency in procedure A, step 4, what is going wrong? Brainstorm some solutions. Dimmers exist in the real world. What is their solution?

    The frequency is too small, so the on time of the led is too short and the off time is too large. The solution would be to increase the frequency so that the led is on for longer amounts of time.

5. Why do you need to connect the logic analyzer ground to the ESP32 ground?

    The ground needs to be consistent for the circuit to work and to get an accurate reading on the logic analyzer.

6. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous communication?

    Synchronous communication is done on constant time intervals and there is no gap between data. Asynchronous communication is done on random time intervals and there are gaps between information.
